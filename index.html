            <p>Walker is notably known for starting the company Walker & Co., which creates products for shaving and facial grooming for black men, by Bevel, as well as hair products for black women. He created these products for black people, to make sure their needs were provided for as he felt the world of health and beauty did not fully recognize or care for black people. He hopes there are more products for different hair types and skin types.
